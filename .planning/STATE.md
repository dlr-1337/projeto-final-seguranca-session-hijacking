# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-09)

**Core value:** A demonstracao deve provar, de forma reproduzivel e local, que uma sessao insegura pode ser sequestrada e que as correcoes implementadas impedem a reutilizacao indevida da sessao.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — vulnerable-lab-foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (vulnerable-lab-foundation) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 2
Status: Phase complete — ready for verification

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Initialization: Build a local, controlled Session Hijacking lab with vulnerable and fixed modes.
- Planning: Use vertical MVP phases so every phase moves the practical demo forward.
- Stack research: Prefer Node.js, Express, and express-session for a compact academic demo.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Fixed-mode `Secure` cookies need HTTPS or a clear localhost explanation during the demo.

## Deferred Items

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| Enhancement | Docker packaging | v2 | Initial requirements |
| Enhancement | Full automated cookie/session tests | v2 | Initial requirements |
| Enhancement | Detailed self-signed HTTPS certificate workflow | v2 | Initial requirements |
